My expectations for my journey in CMSC 100 is to effectively learn WEB PROGRAMMING as someone who does not have any
background knowledge with the course's content (as shown in the course guide). I also expect to be able to thoroughly
understand and make use of the skills that I can learn (especially the skills required for collaborative work).

Galang : I agree with the expecations as someone who has little to know knowledge yet about the topic of web programming, hoping that
everything would be smooth sailing for this semester.
